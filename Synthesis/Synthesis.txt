Synthesis converts RTL code into a hardware circuit made of logic gates, optimized for timing, area, and power.
Tools used:
1.Yosys
-it used to generate netlist from the rtl code
2.ABC
-it is used for mapping technology
Generated output
Design name:RISC V
TNS(total net slack)=759.46
WNS(worst net slack)=24.89
