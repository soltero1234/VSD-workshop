# VSD-workshop
Author: Omsaiprakash Atchamsetti

Design name: RISC-V

Technology: SkyWater 130nm(Sky130)

Course name: Digital VLSI SoC Design

Tools Used: OpenLane, Yosys, Openroad, Magic

This project documents my implementation of a RISC-V based digital design taken through the complete ASIC physical design flow using the open-source SKY130 PDK.
During the workshop, I carried the design from RTL all the way to a final GDSII layout, gaining hands-on experience with a real chip design environment.

The flow covered all major backend stages, including:

1.Synthesis 

2.Floorplanning

3.Placement

4.Clock Tree Synthesis 

5.Routing

6.Static Timing Analysis 

7.GDS2 and signoff checks

This project helped me understand and execute the full RTL-to-GDSII pipeline, reinforcing industry-relevant concepts in digital VLSI and SoC design.
